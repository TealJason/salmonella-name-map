        <h2>
            This website contains tools for looking up Salmonella serovar names or an antigenic formula given one or the other,
            and can also be used for finding the distance between a given location and the closest place in which a salmonella serovar has been named after!
        </h2>

<div class="about-text">
        Salmonella is a gram-negative genus of bacteria wihthin the family Enterobacteriaceae.
        It includes a range of pathogens that infects human, livestock, and wild animal hosts, this contributes to significant diarrhoeal burden and makes it a pathogen of interest from a one health contex.
        Sallmonella will normally clear in healthy groups but in vulnerable groups Salmonella can be life threatening and may progress to further complications such as bacteremia. 

        Salmonella species have a unique nomenclature compared to some other bacteria.
        Salmonella are split into two species, S.bongori, ~22 species and S.enterica >2500 species, S.enterica is then further split into six subspecies.
        These subspecies are then furhter devided based on their phenotypic surface antigens O, H1 and H2.
        O antigens are a set of polysaccharides found on most gram-negative bacteria and is a major component of the Salmonella outer membrane.
        H antigens are the flagella of bacteria which are dependent on what known as the phase. Salmonella are capable of whats know as phase variation where based on environmental conditions can change the expression of its flagella through gene inversions.
        This phase variation is represented as H1 and H2 which shows the two possible phentoypes for both phases that can be seen in the flagella, although not all salmonella phase their flagella.
        
        These unique combinations of O and H antigens create unique combiations of phenotypes that refered to as the serovar or serotype.
        These serovars are represented as an antigentic formula like so, 6,7,14:a:e,n,x in this formula the : deliniates between the antigens in question. 
        So in the previous example this Salmonella is positive for O antigens 6,7, and 14 and in its flagella are positive for the antigens 'a' when in first phase and 'e,n,x' while in its second phase.
        For ease of use these antigenic formulas are then traditioanlly named after where they were first isolated, the above formula denotes Salmonella Oslo for example.
