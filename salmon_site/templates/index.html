        <h1>Welcome to the Salmonella Serovar Finder</h1>
        Salmonella is a gram-negative genus of bacteria wihthin the family Enterobacteriaceae.
        It includes a range of pathogens that infect a range of hosts. 
        Salmonella species are given a unique nolmenclature compared to other bacteria.
        Salmonellas are split into S.bongori and S.enterica with S.enterica further split into six subspecies.
        These subspecies are then even furhter devided based on the phenotypic surface anitgenis O H1 and H2.
        O antigens are the surface antigens presented.
        H1 and H2 are the possible flagellar phenotpyes a species is capable of possesing dependent on environmental conditions.
        These unique combinations of O and H antigens create phenotpypes that are known as the serovar or serotpye.
        These serovars are represented as an antigentic formula like so 6,7,14:r:1,5 where the : deliniates between the antigens in question 
        so in the previous example this salmonella has the O antigens 6,7, and 14 and expresses either flagellar r or 1,5.
        These antigenic formulas are traditioanlly named after where they were first isolated, e.g Salmonella Oslo

        This website contains tools for looking up the name of a serovar given the antigenic formula, looking up the formula from the serovar name
        and also for finding the closest place in which salmonella serovar has been named after to you!
