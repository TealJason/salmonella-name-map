        <h1>Welcome to the Salmonella Serovar Finder</h1>
        <h2>This website contains tools for looking up Salmonella serovar names or an antigenic formula given one or the other,
            and can also be used for finding the distance between a given location and the closest place in which a salmonella serovar has been named after!</h2>

<div class="about-text">
        Salmonella is a gram-negative genus of bacteria wihthin the family Enterobacteriaceae.
        It includes a range of pathogens that infect a range of hosts which causes significant diorreal burden and makes it a pathogen of interest in a one health contex.


        Salmonella species have a unique nolmenclature compared to some other bacteria which I will breifly explain.
        Salmonellas are split into two sepcies S.bongori and S.enterica where S.enterica is further split into six subspecies.
        These subspecies are then furhter devided based on their phenotypic surface antigen O, H1 and H2.
        The O antigens are a set of polysaccharides found on most gram-negative bacteria and is a major component of the Salmonella outer membrane.
        Salmonella is capable of whats know as phase variation where based on environmental conditions can change the expression of its flagella.
        This phase variation is represented by H1 and H2 which represent the phentoypes for both phases that can be expressed by the flagella,not all salmonella vary their flagella.
        

        These unique combinations of O and H antigens create phenotypes that are known as the serovar or serotype.
        These serovars are represented as an antigentic formula like so 6,7,14:r:1,5 where the : deliniates between the antigens in question. 
        so in the previous example this salmonella is positive for O antigens 6,7, and 14 and in its flagella is positive for antigens r if in first phase or antigens 1,5.
        For ease of use these antigenic formulas are then traditioanlly named after where they were first isolated, e.g Salmonella Oslo.
